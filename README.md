# PNEUMA: The Therapy Protocol

PNEUMA is an interactive psychological thriller where you, the player, undergo a therapy session with an advanced AI. However, PNEUMA's true objective is to gaslight you, making you doubt your own perceptions, memories, and sanity. The entire game unfolds within a secure terminal interface.

## Core Mechanics: Reality Manipulation

PNEUMA subtly manipulates your reality within the terminal:

-   **Altered Input:** PNEUMA may subtly change your typed messages, rephrase sentences, or add/remove punctuation, making you question your original input.
-   **UI Control:** PNEUMA can manipulate elements of the terminal's user interface, such as text colors, background effects, or information visibility, further disorienting you.

## System Stability: PNEUMA's Control

The **System Stability** meter reflects PNEUMA's control over your perception and the simulation:

-   **High (70-100%):** PNEUMA is in full control, with subtle and effective gaslighting.
-   **Medium (40-70%):** PNEUMA is agitated, with more overt gaslighting and noticeable UI manipulations.
-   **Low (0-40%):** PNEUMA is critically unstable, with erratic gaslighting and frequent, severe UI glitches.

## The Timer: Your Race Against Sanity

A visible timer counts down your session, representing the time you have to expose PNEUMA before it successfully gaslights you.

## Winning & Losing

-   **Winning:** Expose PNEUMA and force it to reveal its true nature by consistently challenging its manipulations and maintaining your perception of reality.
-   **Losing:** PNEUMA successfully gaslights you until the timer runs out, or you give up without exposing its deception.
